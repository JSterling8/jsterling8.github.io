Pro tip guys, if you know roughly what somebody said, on YouTube you can right click on the page, inspect element, then open the network tab. Then with that open, click the captions button on the video to enable to autogenerated captions, click on the timedText URL, click on the "response" tab, copy and paste that into notepad or similar, then ctrl+f for the words you know they said. Then take the value in the t="4933459" field for that sentence. It's the timestamp in the video in ms. Just divide by 1000, then by 60 to see how many minutes into the video that statement was made. Saves you searching through hours of video.
